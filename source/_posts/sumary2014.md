## PREFACE 
After everything gets done and suddenly, I just realize that time has come to 2015. Look back to the passed year at this moment, I can't help sighing with emotions. It is really a wonderful and significant year for me although with much pressure and not a few tough days. Finally and fortunately, I have come through all of these, happiness, struggles as well as hardships. Thanks for everything and everyone that I met, precious memory and of course some remarkable lessons.

### This year I have encountered some setbacks...

- Setbacks in research
I spent the first year implementing my initial idea on the research smoothly. That was a giant enhancement for my self-confidence and I planned to finished my second idea using the next year. I had been always believed that I can realize whatever if I really decide to do until I finally give up after several hard attempts. Maybe it is nothing serious about my thesis, but it makes me start to doubt myself, and it is a little difficulty to rebuild the self-confidence. Remember, giving up should be never allowed!

- Setbacks in affection
I am always confused about that what shall I do if I love someone who doesn't love me. especially the 'someone' is one of your best friend. Because it takes me a long time to fall in love with someone and takes me longer to clean her away from my heart. Sometimes you have to sacrifice love in order to save friendship, but sometimes just the opposite!

- Setbacks in job application
It is not a smooth process. Sometimes you will get tired, you will be refused or cheated and sometimes you will lose your confidence. But you do need to believe that you will get what you want as long as you stick up to the end. Remember, this is true!

- Setbacks in health
If you get seriously sick, you will feel those common strangers across the street so happy just because they are healthy. But when you get better, your happiness by the recovery will soon filled up with variable annoyances. That's because you are always ignoring what you already have and asking more less important. Remember, a man who is contented is always happy.

### This year I have got some achievements...

## PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE

2014 is a year with sweets and bitters, ups and downs, joys and sorrows, pains and gains. Anyway, the past is over, and all we can do is learn from them.
Here and now, I would like to hold a memorial ceremony for my school days, that's 20+ years since I was six years old. That is the whole teenage and youth!
2015, just be more mature, more confident, more healthy and more brave. Do the job, improve myself, earn money and honor my parents.
Let's go, 2015!
